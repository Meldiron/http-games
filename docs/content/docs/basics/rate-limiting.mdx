## Rate limits

HTTP Games implements rate limiting to ensure fair gameplay for all players, and introduce optimization challenge for vivid players.

<Callout>
Rate limiting is enforced at 1 request per second per unique identifier. An identifier is a token in `Authorization` header, or your IP address.
</Callout>

If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with `type` set to `rate_limit_exceeded` in the response body. 

## Best Practices

There are many strategies to respect rate limits. Below you can find examples of the simplest one, but you are encouraged to explore more advanced strategies, and build the most optimal playthrough.

### Retry Logic

When sending any request, catch 429 response code, and attempt to re-send same request after a second.

```python
import requests
import time

def make_request_with_retry(url, attempt=1):
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 429:
        if attempt > 3:
            raise Exception("Request could not be re-sent.")
    
        time.sleep(1)
        return make_request_with_retry(url, attempt + 1)
    return None

response = make_request_with_retry("https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/health")

print("Status: ", response.status_code)
print("Body: ", response.json())
```

### Space Out Requests

Instead of sending requests as fast as possible, add one second delay before or after each request.

```python
import requests
import time

response = requests.get("https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/health")
print("Status: ", response.status_code)
print("Body: ", response.json())
time.sleep(1)

response = requests.get("https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/health")
print("Status: ", response.status_code)
print("Body: ", response.json())
time.sleep(1)

response = requests.get("https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/health")
print("Status: ", response.status_code)
print("Body: ", response.json())
time.sleep(1)
```

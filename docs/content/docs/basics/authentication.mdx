description: Register an account, sign into the account, and obtain a token.

## Preparation

You don't need to setup anything! Any runtime or language you are already using is capable of sending HTTP requests, so simply use what you are familiar with.

All examples will be written as CURL requests. This format is easy to run in terminal, import into HTTP clients, and all AI agents understand it, so you can easily convert it into your preferred programming language.

Here is example of a CURL request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/health
```

After running the command, you should see a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## Signing up

To register an account, send an HTTP request with email, password (twice), and a nickname.

Email is used only for authentication purposes, so it will not be publicly displayed. Only your nickname will be public.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "nickname": "User123",
    "password": "password",
    "passwordConfirmation": "password"
  }' \
  https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/users
```

import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Response">
    ### Bad request (400)
      
    Error usually thrown when body is missing or invalid. Common reasons are password confirmation missmatch, too short password and nickname, or invalid email address.
    
    ### Conflict (409)
    
    Error caused by using email or nickname that is linked to an already existing account.
    
    ### Created (201)
    
    Your account has been created successfully. Response includes detail about your account, including some new ones such as your user ID, or more importantly, your token for authentication.
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "6912ef18b...",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "nickname": "User123",
      "token": "sk_Guei2HJgU..."
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Obtaining a token

Ensure you have [signed up](#signing-up) first, and you remember your email and password.

To obtain a new token, send an HTTP request with your credentials.

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }' \
  https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/tokens
```

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Response">
    ### Bad request (400)
    
    Error usually thrown when body is missing or invalid. Common reason is invalid credentials.
    
    ### Created (201)
    
    A token has been created successfully. Response includes detail about your token, your token's secret.
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "6394ab479...",
      "userId": "6912ef18b...",
      "secret": "sk_Guei2HJgU..."
    }
    ```
    
    Make sure to note down the token's secret, you will need it in the future.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Sending authorized requests

In all requests sent when playing games, you will need to provide your token's secret in `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk_Guei2HJgU...
```

If you haven't yet obtained a token, follow [Signing up](#signing-up) and [Obtaining a token](#obtaining-a-token) sections.

To test this out, you can send a request to get details about your account. This request can only succeed if you have a valid token of a valid user.

```bash
curl \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_Guei2HJgU...' \
  https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/users/[YOUR_USER_ID]
```

<Callout>
  Remember to update URL with your user ID. If you don't remember it, refer to
  [Obtaining a token](#obtaining-a-token) section, since a response of a new token includes your user ID too.
</Callout>

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Response">
    ### Unauthorized (401)
    
    Error thrown when token is missing or invalid. Make sure your token is valid, and the header is properly set.
    
    ### Forbidden (403)
    
    Error thrown when the token is valid, but it's a token of another user. You probably sent request with wrong user ID in the URL path.
    
    ### Success (200)
    
    You get details about your account, indicating you are properly authenticated and permitted to see details about your account.
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "67c0eaa...",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "nickname": "User123"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

You have successfully opened your account, signed in, and made your very first authenticated request! You are now ready to play HTTP games.

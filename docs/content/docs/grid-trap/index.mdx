# GridTrap

Welcome to GridTrap, a procedurally generated dungeon escape game that will test your strategy, and a little bit of luck. You play as a brave cartographer who has fallen into a mysterious underground dungeon filled with deadly traps, and your only goal is simple: **get out alive**.

## The Story

You wake up in a dark, stone dungeon with only the faint glimmer of torchlight to guide your way. The entrance you fell through has sealed shut behind you, but somewhere in this maze of corridors lies your salvation - a rope that can carry you back to the surface. The catch? The floor is riddled with hidden trapdoors that will send you plummeting into even deeper chambers if you're not careful.

## How to Play

### Your Mission

Navigate through the dungeon grid by moving one tile at a time in any of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). Your ultimate objective is to find and reach the escape rope.

### The Dungeon Layout
Every dungeon is a grid of tiles, each with its own secrets:

- **Safe Ground**: Appears solid and reliable
- **Hidden Traps**: Look exactly like safe ground until you step on them
- **Stone Walls**: Impassable barriers that block your path  
- **The Entrance**: Where you begin your harrowing journey
- **The Rope**: Your ticket to freedom - find it and climb to victory!

### The Danger

Here's where it gets interesting: some of those innocent-looking floor tiles are actually concealed traps. Step on one, and you'll fall through, becoming temporarily trapped in the chamber below. In normal mode, you can crawl back to the entrance and try to avoid the trap on next try. But if you're feeling brave enough to play in **hardcore mode**, a single misstep means game over - no second chances.

## Game Modes

### Standard Mode

Perfect for learning the ropes (pun intended). If you fall into a trap, you can crawl back to safety and continue your escape attempt. Take your time to learn the dungeon's layout and develop your strategy.

### Hardcore Mode  

For the truly fearless. One trap, and it's all over. Every step becomes a calculated risk, and the tension builds with each move. Do you have what it takes to escape on your first try?

## Dungeon Sizes

Choose your challenge level:

- **4x4 Grid (Easy)**: A cozy 16-tile dungeon perfect for beginners
- **7x7 Grid (Medium)**: 49 tiles of moderate challenge
- **10x10 Grid (Hard)**: A sprawling 100-tile maze that will test even veteran explorers

## Ready to Begin?

Armed with nothing but your courage and strategic thinking, you're ready to face the GridTrap challenge. Will you methodically explore every safe path, or will you make bold moves toward the rope? Will you play it safe in standard mode, or dive straight into the unforgiving hardcore experience?

The dungeon awaits, and your escape rope is out there somewhere. Good luck, cartographer!

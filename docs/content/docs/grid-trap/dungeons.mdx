## Create a dungeon

In a game of Grid Trap, your goal is to escape from a dungeon by avoiding trapdoors.

To start a new game, send a following CURL request to create a new dungeon:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_Guei2HJgU...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "size": "4x4",
    "hardcore": false
  }' \
  https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/games/grid-trap/dungeons
```

<AutoTypeTable name="AutoTypeTableExample" type='export interface AutoTypeTableExample {
    /**
    * A size of grid in which you will play.
    * 
    * - Easy is `4x4`
    * - Medium is `7x7`
    * - Hard is `10x10`
    **/
    size?: "10x10" | "7x7" | "4x4";

    /**
    * In hardcore mode, you are not allowed to fall into same trap twice.
    * 
    * - Enabled is `true`
    * - Disabled is `false`
    **/
    hardcore?: boolean;
    
    /**
    * Generate dungeon with specific seed, to have consistent layout.
    * 
    * Be aware, customizing seed may disable some achievements.
    * 
    * - Minimum: 1
    * - Maximum: 9223372036
    **/
    seed?: integer;
}' />

    ### Internal server error (500)
        
    Internal error, likely due to dungeon generation. Hopefully never happens, and if it does, re-sending same request likely helps.
  
    ### Bad request (400)
      
    Error usually thrown when body is missing or invalid. Common reasons are invalid JSON, or extra comma somewhere.
    
    ### Unauthorized (401)
    
    Error caused by missing or invalid token in authorization header.
    
    ### Created (201)
    
    Dungeon has been created and you can play it.

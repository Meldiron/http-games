In a game of Grid Trap, your goal is to escape from a dungeon by avoiding trapdoors.

To start a new game, send a following CURL request to create a new dungeon:

```bash
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_Guei2HJgU...' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "size": "3x3",
    "hardcore": false
  }' \
  https://api.http-games.almostapps.eu/v1/games/grid-trap/dungeons
```

<AutoTypeTable name="AutoTypeTableExample" type='export interface AutoTypeTableExample {
    /**
    * A size of grid in which you will play.
    * 
    * - Easy is `3x3`
    * - Medium is `5x5`
    * - Hard is `7x7`
    **/
    size: "3x3" | "5x5" | "7x7";

    /**
    * In hardcore mode, you are not allowed to fall into same trap twice.
    * 
    * - Enabled is `true`
    * - Disabled is `false`
    **/
    hardcore: boolean;
}' />
